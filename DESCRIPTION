Description: The National Hospital Discharge Survey (2010)
    summarizes the state of patients at the end of their hospital
    admissions. The US CDC publishes the data in the public domain, and
    describes it as follows: The National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS)
    is a continuing nationwide sample survey of short-stay hospitals in
    the United States. The scope of NHDS encompasses patients discharged
    from noninstitutional hospitals, exclusive of military and Department
    of Veterans Affairs hospitals, located in the 50 States and the
    District of Columbia. Only hospitals having six or more beds for
    in-patient use are included in the survey. See
    <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhds> for more information.
